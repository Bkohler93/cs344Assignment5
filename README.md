# cs344Assignment5: Message encryptor using IPC

This is a submission for an assignment administered by Oregon State University for CS344 (Operating Systems I).

## Description
Five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information. 
The first program is a key generator that generates a random key consisting of upper-case letters (A-Z) and spaces.
Then there are two programs users can use to encrypt or decrypt messages. Users provide the program with a textfile of encrypted/decrypted text and a key, and then the programs send this data to the servers to be encrypted/decrypted. These programs then print out the resultant encrypted/decrypted text.
